# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## 1. Overview of Project
     The purpose of this analysis was to visualize the campaign outcomes of plays based on the funding goal and based on the launch date. In other words, we want to figure out if the success of the play campaigns has to do with how much money can be raised by a certain date. 
## 2. Analysis and Challenges
    In order to perform this analysis, I created two new sheets to focus on the outomes of plays. 
### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    I first made a pivot chart to filter the data by subcategory (plays) and launch date, by month. We can now see the outcome of plays by month. From there, I created a line graph based on this filtered data. By using a line graph we can look at trends by month and see that the month with the most successful plays was in May, while the month with the most failed was in October. A possible challenge could be filtering the launch date by month. In order to display the data this way I learned how the group function works and specified months. (insert image)
### Outcomes Based on Goals
    To start, I created a new sheet grouping the number of successful, failed, and canceled plays by a range of goal funding amount.
